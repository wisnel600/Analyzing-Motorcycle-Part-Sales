Analyzing Motorcycle Part Sales


Derive insights about motorcycle part sales over time across multiple warehouse sites!

Project instruction
Find out how much Wholesale net revenue each product_line generated per month per warehouse in the dataset.

The query should be saved as revenue_by_product_line using the SQL cell provided, and contain the following:
product_line, 
month: displayed as 'June', 'July', and 'August', 
warehouse, 
and net_revenue: the sum of total minus the sum of payment_fee.

The results should be sorted by product_line and month, followed by net_revenue in descending order.
Note: Please also ensure that you do not change the name of the DataFrame that the query result will be saved as - creating new cells in the workbook will produce a DataFrame with a different name. Make sure that your final solution uses the names provided: revenue_by_product_line (see image below).


You're working for a company that sells motorcycle parts, and they've asked for some help in analyzing their sales data!

They operate three warehouses in the area, selling both retail and wholesale. They offer a variety of parts and accept credit cards, cash, and bank transfer as payment methods. However, each payment type incurs a different fee.

The board of directors wants to gain a better understanding of wholesale revenue by product line, and how this varies month-to-month and across warehouses. You have been tasked with calculating net revenue for each product line and grouping results by month and warehouse. The results should be filtered so that only "Wholesale" orders are included.

They have provided you with access to their database, which contains the following table called sales.




SELECT product_line,
       TO_CHAR(date, 'Month') AS month,
       warehouse,
       SUM(total) - SUM(payment_fee) AS net_revenue
FROM sales
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) IN (6,7,8)
  AND client_type = 'Wholesale'
GROUP BY product_line, TO_CHAR(date, 'Month'), warehouse
ORDER BY product_line DESC, month DESC, net_revenue DESC;
